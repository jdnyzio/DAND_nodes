In this problem set, you'll be investigating your best customers.  
Who are they, where are they from, and what are they spending?
You'll use subqueries, joins, csvs, and your ability to create databases and tables to make it happen.

What we want to do here is create a new database, and create a table to import your query into.
In the next slide, you'll learn to export your view as a CSV and import this file into your table.

See if you can create a schema that will match the file you are importing!
