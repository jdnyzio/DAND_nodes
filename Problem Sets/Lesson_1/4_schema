#The columns in a database make up its schema.  Knowing the schema helps 
#you query the table by knowing what actually exists in the table to be queried.  

#Can you find the schema of the track table and fill in the missing values?


#Answer
CREATE TABLE [Track]
(
    [TrackId] INTEGER  NOT NULL,
    [Name] NVARCHAR(200)  NOT NULL,
    [AlbumId] INTEGER,
    [MediaTypeId] INTEGER  NOT NULL,
    [GenreId] INTEGER,
    [Composer] NVARCHAR(220),
    [Milliseconds] INTEGER  NOT NULL,
    [Bytes] INTEGER,
    [UnitPrice] NUMERIC(10,2)  NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_Track] PRIMARY KEY  ([TrackId]),
    FOREIGN KEY ([AlbumId]) REFERENCES [Album] ([AlbumId]) 
		ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION,
    FOREIGN KEY ([GenreId]) REFERENCES [Genre] ([GenreId]) 
		ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION,
    FOREIGN KEY ([MediaTypeId]) REFERENCES [MediaType] ([MediaTypeId]) 
		ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION
);


#Why this question?

#The student will need to use .help and understand how .schema ?TABLE? works.
#It is their first introduction to schema and will show they are able to understand what 
#they are seeing.  Getting the schema will be important to be able to ask query questions
#later in the problem set.  I chose track because it has a few rows.  They might be a little 
overwhelmed but with a fill in the blanks question they should be able to copy what they 
are seeing and gain a bit of confidence reading a schema.
