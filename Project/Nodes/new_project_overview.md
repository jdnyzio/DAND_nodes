**Project Overview**
--------------------

You will choose any area of the world in
[https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and use
data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for
validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean
the OpenStreetMap data for unique piece of your world.

Next, you will prepare this data to put into a personal SQLite3 database
to query and explore. Finally, you will use
[*QGIS*](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/), an open source geographic
information system, to visualize, explore, and share your map with the
world. [*(example maps)*](http://demo.qgis.org/)

Prepare for this project with: [Intro to Data
Wrangling](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud032-nd) and [SQL
for Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud032-nd).

**Note**
--------

If you have successfully completed the project in the past (which
entails having graduated from the course and having access to your
course certificate), simply email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com
with your passing evaluation and we'll give you credit for this project.

**Why this Project?**
---------------------

Data Wrangling and databases lay at the foundation of all great Data
Science. It’s important that you are able to collect and manage data so
that any further analysis is built upon a solid foundation. Having the
skills needed to clean a wide variety of data gives you access to an
incredible amount of otherwise inaccessible information. Using the SQL
query language gives you the power to indulge your curiosity and answer
so many new questions you may have about your dataset.

Throughout this project, you’ll put all these skills to use in a way
that shows employers you have what it takes to utilize these incredibly
important skills. Once you’ve completed your project, you’ll have the
confidence and skills to tackle a whole new world of data. You’re now
well on your way to mastering the tasks that practicing Data Scientists
have said can take up to 50-80% of their time.

Welcome to the OpenStreetMaps project. We’re so excited to see the world
you create!

**What will I learn?**
----------------------

After completing the project, you will be able to:

-   Assess the quality of the data for 
    > validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity

-   Parse and gather data from popular file formats such as 
    > json, xml, csv, html.

-   Store data into a Relational Database Management System and answer questions about it using the SQL query language.

-   Use QGIS, an open source geographic information system,
    > to convert osm geographical data into an SQLite database to create and host
    your own map online.

**Why is this Important to my Career?**

TODO - Should I use specific information from the SME here?
