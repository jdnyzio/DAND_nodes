## Introducting QGIS
In this project you'll be using QGIS, desktop graphic user interface, to help convert your OSM data into an SQLite database, and later host an online interactive map from your data.

For an quick introduction to QGIS and it's capabilites have a look at the [QGIS about page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/about/).

## Note
If you have successfully completed the project for the Data Wrangling with MongoDB course in the past (which entails having graduated from the course and having access to your course certificate), simply email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com with your passing evaluation and we'll give you credit for this project.


## Why this Project?
What’s so hard about retrieving data from databases or various files formats? You grab some data from this file and that database, clean it up, merge it, and then feed it into your state of the art, deep learning algorithm … Right? 

But the reality is this -- anyone who has worked with data extensively knows it is an absolute nightmare to get data from different data sources to play well with each other. 

And this project will teach you all of the skills you need to deal with even the most nightmarish data wrangling scenarios.  

## What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will be able to:

* Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity
* Parsing and gather data from popular file formats such as json, xml, csv, html
* Process data from many files and very large files that can be cleaned with spreadsheet programs
* Learn how to store, query, and aggregate data using MongoDB



## Why is this Important to my Career?
As this [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html) points out, the less heralded part of doing data science is manually collecting and cleaning data so it can be easily explored and analyzed later. Or otherwise known as “data wrangling” or “data munging” in the data science community. 

Though not as glamorous as building cool machine learning models, data wrangling is a task that data scientists can spend up to 50-80% of their time doing according to many practicing data analyst and data scientists.
