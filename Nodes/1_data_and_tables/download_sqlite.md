Getting Started with SQLite3 
=============================

### Downloading SQLite3

Throughout the course, you’ll have the opportunity to run a local
database. This is a great way to experiment with your own ideas and
learn to run queries locally. There are a few ways to get started using
SQLite3 on your computer.

1\. If you’ve got a Mac, SQLite likely came preinstalled on your
operating system. Open your terminal and type **sqlite3.** If you see
something like the following

```
SQLite version 3.8.4.1 2014-03-11 15:27:36

Enter ".help" for usage hints.

Connected to a **transient in-memory database**.

Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.

sqlite>
```

Then you already have SQLite installed. Type **.exit** to get back to your
terminal and you’re ready to go!

2\. If you’ve downloaded the Python Anaconda Distribution, SQLite has
been installed on your computer. Downloading this software is a great
way to get started with python and comes packaged with many tools you
may end up using as you continue to work with data.

Distribution on your computer have a look at (INSERT LINK HERE)

3\. If you would like to see alternative ways to download SQLite on your
local computer have a look at [*Tutorials
Point*](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm%20in%20your%20browser.)
for more details on getting started. This site is also a great reference
for SQLite materials and commands.

> Once you’ve got SQLite3 downloaded on your computer, you’ll be able to
run commands locally and practice building and querying a live database.
This is an important skill to have when working with data and will come
in handy if you are completing the OpenStreetMaps project associated
with this course.
