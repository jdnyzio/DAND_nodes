In this problem set, you'll be investigating your best customers.  
Who are they, where are they from, and what are they spending?
You'll use subqueries, joins, csvs, and your ability to create databases and tables to make it happen.

CREATE VIEW course_size as 
SELECT course_id, COUNT(*) as num
FROM enrollment
GROUP by course_id;

See if you can turn your query into a view!

QUERY = '''
